<h1>
  Shell Folders Unit<br />
  <span class="subtitle">Demo Program ReadMe</span>
</h1>


<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  This project is provided with the DelphiDabbler <em>Shell Folders Unit</em> to
  demonstrate how to use some of the code in the unit.
</p>

<p>
  The project requires Delphi 7 as a minimum and should compile on all later
  compilers. Both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows targets are supported when compiling
  with Delphi XE2 or later. The project has been tested with Delphi 7, 2006,
  2007, 2009, 2010, XE, XE2, XE3 and XE4.
</p>


<h2>
  Installing the Demo Project
</h2>

<p>
  The demo project is provided in the same zip file as the <em>Shell Folders
  Unit</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The Shell Folder components must be installed before trying to compile this
  demo. If compiling for a 64 bit Windows target ensure that the components have
  been built into a 64 bit package.
</p>

<p>
  Copy the code from the <code>Demo</code> sub-folder of the zip file to some
  suitable location on your hard drive then open the
  <code>ShellFolderDemo.dpr</code> project in Delphi. If the compiler can't find
  the component's .dcu file place the directory where you installed the
  components on your compiler's search path.
</p>

<p>
  By default the demo compiles as a 32 bit Windows application. When using
  Delphi XE2 or later you can compile the project as a 64 bit Windows
  application simply by using the IDE to add a 64 bit target to the project and
  recompiling.
</p>


<h2>
  Overview
</h2>

<p>
  The program exercises much of the main code in
  <code>PJShellFolders.pas</code>. On starting the program displays information
  about each of the supported special shell folders in the main part of the
  window. This information is:
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    ID: the symbolic constant associated with the folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Display name: the display name of the folder (or &lt;not supported&gt; if
    the folder is not supported by the underlying operating system).
  </li>
  <li>
    Folder path: the path to the folder in the file system. If the folder is not
    part of the physical file system, i.e. is virtual, then &lt;virtual
    folder&gt; is displayed. No entry is present for unsupported folders.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below the main display are several controls:
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    <em>Browse selected folder</em> button:<br />
    Clicking this button displays the <em>Browse for Folder</em> dialogue box
    with the selected special folder as the root in the display. Click the
    button to experiment with the dialogue, the behaviour of which changes
    according to the state of other control. If the selected folder is not
    supported by the operating system the button is disabled. The dialogue can
    also be displayed by double clicking the folder's entry in the display.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Dialog Box Options</em> group box:<br />
    This group box contains check boxes that enable and disable associated
    options in the browse dialogue box's <var>Options</var> properties, as
    follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Show Help</em>:<br />
        Displays a help button in the dialogue box. The button will be disabled
        because no help context is assigned to the dialogue box &ndash;
        assigning a non-zero help context would enable the button. No help
        button is displayed if <em>New Style Dialog</em> is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Context Help</em>:<br />
        Displays a &quot;<strong>?</strong>&quot; button in the dialogue box
        title and enables context sensitive help. <strong>Note:</strong> this
        only works on some operating systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Status Text</em>:<br />
        Displays status text in the dialogue box. The status text is set in the
        demo's <var>OnSelChange</var> and <var>OnSelChangeEx</var> event
        handlers. Status text is not displayed if <em>New Style Dialog</em> is
        checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Directories Only</em>:<br />
        Displays only folders from the file system in the dialogue box. Virtual
        folders are not displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>New Style Dialog</em>:<br />
        Displays the dialogue in the new style. It is resizeable and displays a
        <em>Make New Folder</em> button by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Hide &quot;Make Folder&quot; Button</em>:<br />
        Hides the <em>Make New Folder</em> button that appears by default on the
        new style dialogue. This option is ignored if <em>New Style Dialog</em>
        is not checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Display Edit Box</em><br />
        Displays an edit control in the dialogue box. Enter a path in this
        control. A valid path will be used as the selected folder when the
        dialogue box is closed. If the entered path is not valid it will be
        ignored and the <var>OnValidationFailed</var> event will be triggered,
        if assigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Display Usage Hint</em><br />
        Causes a usage hint to appear in the dialogue box when checked.
        <em>New Style Dialog</em> must be checked and <em>Display Edit Box</em>
        must be cleared for this to take effect. Furthermore
        <code>shlobj.dll</code> v6.0 or later is also required for this option
        to take effect.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Bold Headline Text</em> check box:<br />
    When checked the <em>Browse for folder</em> dialogue box will display its
    headline text in bold, using the main form's font. This customisation is
    carried out in the demo program's <var>OnInitialize</var> event handler.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Use OnSelChange</em> radio button:<br />
    When this button is checked the browse dialogue box component uses the
    demo's <var>OnSelChange</var> event handler when the selected folder
    changes. The event handler displays the name of the selected folder in the
    dialogue's status text and ensures the <em>OK</em> button is always enabled.
    This event handler does not display status text when <em>New Style
    Dialog</em> check box is checked since the new style dialogue box does not
    support status text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Use OnSelChangeEx</em> radio button:<br />
    When this button is checked the browse dialogue box component uses the
    demo's <var>OnSelChangeEx</var> event handler when the selected folder
    changes. The event handler sets the dialogue's status text to indicate the
    name of the selected folder, along with information about whether the folder
    is virtual. The path to the folder and its small and large icons are
    displayed in the main window. This event handler does not display status
    text when the <em>New Style Dialog</em> check box is checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Use OnValidationFailed</em> check box:<br />
    When this check box is checked the browse dialogue component uses the demo's
    <em>OnValidationFailed</em> event handler when an invalid path is entered in
    any edit control in the dialogue box. The invalid path is displayed and the
    user is asked to decide whether the dialogue box is closed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Source Code
</h2>

<p>
  The main purpose of this demo is to provide source code that shows how to use
  the various classes and components from the <code>PJShellFolders</code> unit.
  The code of <code>ShellFolderDemoForm.pas</code> illustrates the following:
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    The <var>DisplaySpecialFolders</var> method (called from
    <var>FormCreate</var>) uses the <var>IPJSpecialFolderEnum</var> interface,
    implemented by the <var>TPJSpecialFolderEnum</var> class, to display details
    of all supported folders in the main window. The code uses the
    <var>TPJSpecialFolderInfo</var> component to get the information to display.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <var>IsSelectionSupported</var> method uses the
    <var>TPJSpecialFolderInfo</var> component to test to see if the currently
    highlighted folder is supported by the operating system.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <var>BrowseButtonClick</var> event handler sets up the
    <var>TPJBrowseDialog</var> component to display the <em>Browse for
    Folders</em> dialogue using the selected special folder as its root node.
    The <var>TPJBrowseDialog.Execute</var> method is called to display the
    dialogue box. This causes the component's OnInitialise event to fire &ndash;
    how this is handled is described below.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <var>BrowseDialogInitialise</var> method handles the
    <var>TPJBrowseDialog.OnInitialise</var> event and makes the dialogue box
    headline text in bold if the <em>Bold Headline Text</em> check box is
    checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    As folders are selected in the the browse dialogue either the
    <var>TPJBrowseDialog.OnSelChange</var> or
    <var>TPJBrowseDialog.OnSelChangeEx</var> events are handled by the
    <var>BrowseDlgSelChange</var> or <var>BrowseDlgSelChangeEx</var> methods
    respectively, according to the state of the <em>Use OnSelChange</em> and
    <em>Use OnSelChangeEx</em> radio buttons. These event handlers perform as
    follows:
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <var>BrowseDlgSelChange</var>: This event handler simply displays the
        selected folder's display name in the dialogue's status text and ensures
        the dialogue's <em>OK</em> button is always enabled. Status text is
        ignored if the dialogue box has the new style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <var>BrowseDlgSelChangeEx</var>: This event handler gets the display
        name and path from the PIDL passed to the handler and displays folder
        information in the dialogue's status text. It then gets the handle of
        the small and large icons associated with the folder, along with the
        folder's path and displays them in the main form. Status text is ignored
        if the dialogue has the new style.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <var>BrowseDlgValidationFailed</var> event handler handles any
    <var>TPJBrowseDialog.OnValidationFailed</var> events if the <em>Use
    OnValidationFailed</em> check box is checked. It reports the name of the
    invalid folder entered into the browse dialogue's edit control then asks the
    user if the dialogue box is to be closed. The <em>Display Edit Box</em>
    option check boxes must be checked to include the required edit control in
    the dialogue box.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the browse dialogue is closed, the <var>TPJBrowseDialog.OnClose</var>
    event is triggered and handled by the <var>BrowseDlgClose</var> event
    handler. This simply ensures that any icons and path displayed in the main
    window are cleared.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You should run the program and examine the source code to get an idea about
  how to use the <code>PJShellFolders</code> unit.
